# RF24 4-Channel Communication

This project implements a 4-channel communication system using the RF24 module for both transmitting and receiving data. It is designed to be used as part of a quadcopter project.

### Prerequisites

- Arduino IDE
- RF24 library

### Notes

- Do not forget to adjust the pins in the code if you have connected to different pins on your board. For the reference take a look at the [documentation](https://nrf24.github.io/RF24/)
- Powering the modules from external source highly recommended. As in most cases arduino cannot supply enough power to the modules
